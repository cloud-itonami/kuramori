  "OperationActor -- one warehouse-robotics operation = one supervised
  actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor
  (WarehouseAdvisor) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its proposal
  is ALWAYS routed through the Warehouse Robotics Governor (:govern) and
  the rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today)              - `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)             - :advisor opt
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)                - :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one operation (register -> advise -> govern -> decide
  -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop -- each operation
  is auditable and checkpointed. A floor's life is advanced by MANY ops
  (register / assess / plan / dispatch / putaway-commit), each its own run.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human warehouse supervisor. The approver resumes with
  `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or :rejected). `:fleet/dispatch`/
  `:putaway/commit` ALWAYS reach this node when the governor is clean --
  see `kuramori.phase`."
